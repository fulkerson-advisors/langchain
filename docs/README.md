# LangChain Documentation

For more information on contributing to our documentation, see the [Documentation Contributing Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/how_to/documentation).

## Structure

The primary documentation is located in the `docs/` directory and has a different build process than the API reference docs.

API reference documentation is located in `docs/api_reference/` and is automatically generated from the codebase using Sphinx.
The API reference docs are built and deployed separately from the main documentation. See the `README.md` in the `docs/api_reference/`
directory for more details on how to build and contribute to the API reference docs.
